        <h2>UCLA Consent to Participate in Research</h2>
    
        <p><b>Study Title: </b>The dynamics of economic decision making</p>
        <p><b>Protocol Number: </b></p>
        <p><b>Researcher: </b>Ian Krajbich</p>
        <p><b>Sponsors: </b>National Science Foundation and UCLA</p>
    
        <p>This is a consent form for research participation. It contains important information about this study and what to
            expect if you decide to participate.</p>
        <p>Your participation is voluntary.</p>
        <p>Please consider the information carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether or not
            to participate.</p>
    
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people make economic decisions.</p>
    
        <p><b>Procedures/Tasks:</b>
            You will make a series of decisions that may determine your compensation at the end of the study. You may be
            making decisions by yourself, or with other participants. The study may need to be completed across multiple
            sessions. If the study requires multiple sessions, you will receive the invitation for the next sessions after
            you finish the current sessions. Your payment at the end of the study may therefore depend on your decisions,
            the decisions of others, and chance. You may also be asked to provide basic demographic information and answer
            some questionnaires.</p>
    
        <p>For online studies, you will also complete at least one attention check in the form of a quiz on the instructions
            and/or a practice round where we tell you what to select. If you fail the attention checks, your participation
            in the study will end and you will not receive any compensation. If this happens, we will retain your data up to
            that point in the study.</p>
    
        <p>We may use a camera or your webcam to track your eye movements during this process. For the webcam, at some point
            during the study we will ask for permission to turn on your webcam. This is required to complete the study. The
            only thing we will be recording with the webcam is where you appear to be looking on your computer screen. This
            data will simply consist of horizontal and vertical coordinates (i.e. two numbers). There will be a short
            calibration process before the study begins. We may also record the location of your mouse cursor throughout the
            study.</p>
    
        <p><b>Duration:</b>
            One session will be held now and the total duration of this session will be at most 2 hours. The total duration
            of the study depends on the number of sessions. If this study requires 2 sessions, then the total duration of
            the study will be at most 4 hours.</p>
    
        <p>You may leave the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the study, there will be no penalty
            to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your decision will not affect
            your future relationship with UCLA.</p>
    
        <p><b>Risks and Benefits:</b>
            The risks involved in this study are no greater than those encountered in day-to-day life. You will be able to
            contact investigators at any time during the procedures if you have any concerns or difficulties. There are no
            direct benefits to you from participating in this study.</p>
    
        <p><b>Confidentiality:</b>
            We will work to make sure that no one sees your responses without approval. For online studies, because we are
            using the Internet, there is a chance that someone could access your online responses without permission. In
            some cases, this information could be used to identify you.</p>
    
        <p>The online services we are using for this study may temporarily store your data, but this data will be downloaded
            and then promptly deleted from those services.</p>
    
        <p>Your data will not be permanently associated with your name, IP address, or any other identifiable information
            (e.g., your information will only be connected to your payment, not to any of your responses), though they may
            be temporarily stored together before we download and separate them. Even so, no guarantee of internet survey
            security can be given because, although unlikely, transmissions can be intercepted and IP addresses can be
            identified. The anonymous data may be shared publicly (for example, in conjunction with a resulting academic
            publication).</p>
    
        <p>Also, there may be circumstances where this information must be released. For example, personal information
            regarding your participation in this study may be disclosed if required by state law.</p>
    
        <p><b>Future Research:</b>
            Your data may be shared with other researchers for future use.</p>
    
        <p><b>Incentives:</b>
            Your payment will depend on your decisions, the decisions of others in the study, and chance. Minimum incentives
            are $5 per hour. Average payments range between $10 and $20 per hour, but the actual payments can be lower or
            higher than these amounts. If you participate in a multi-session study, you will be paid at the end of each
            session but you will be paid an additional bonus for completing all sessions.</p>
    
        <p>By law, payments to participants are considered taxable income.</p>
    
        <p><b>Participant Rights:</b>
            Your participation in this research is entirely VOLUNTARY. If you decide to participate, you are free to
            withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time without consequences of any kind.</p>
    
        <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty. You are not waiving any
            legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study. If you have questions
            about your rights as a research subject, or you have concerns or suggestions and you want to talk to someone
            other than the researchers, you may contact the UCLA OHRPP by phone: (310) 206-2040; by email:
            participants@research.ucla.edu or by mail: Box 951406, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1406.</p>
    
        <p><b>Contacts and Questions:</b>
            For questions, concerns, or complaints about the study you may contact Dr. Ian Krajbich (krajbich@ucla.edu).</p>
